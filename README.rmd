# QUESTION 1: US BABY NAMES

Step 1: uploading the data, view the format with view(Baby\_/Names)

```{r}
Baby_Names <- read_rds("./data/PracData25/US_Baby_names/Baby_Names_By_US_State.rds")
Top_100_Billboard <- read_rds("./data/PracData25/US_Baby_names/charts.rds")
HBO_titles <- read_rds("./data/PracData25/US_Baby_names/HBO_titles.rds")
HBO_credits <- read_rds("./data/PracData25/US_Baby_names/HBO_credits.rds")

view(Baby_Names)
view(Top_100_Billboard)
view(HBO_titles) # need to merge these to to have the release date with the actors/ characters names
view(HBO_credits)

#Join the HBO titles and credits
HBO_joined <- HBO_credits %>%
  left_join(HBO_titles, by = "id")

```

I came across a biggggg issue with the naming conventions of the "year"
and "name" columns, so I decided to rather change the functions back to
using "name" and "year" for simplicity and to then rename the columns in
each dataset. This felt more simple!

```{r}

#tidy up the column names for ease of use: 
Baby_Names <- Baby_Names %>%
  rename(name = Name) %>% rename(year = Year)

#Now, since I want to compare the correlation for girls and boys separately, I need to infer the gender of the HBO and Billboard lists - which I can do by looking each name up in the US-babynames dataset.

# add gender & rename name columns

Top_100_Billboard <- Top_100_Billboard %>% rename(name = artist) #the dates is in numeric here, can add year col
Billboard_MF <- add_gender(df = Top_100_Billboard)

#Hbo artists
HBO_MF <- add_gender(HBO_joined)

#HBO_MF_new <- charadd_gender(HBO_MF)

#now apply to character
HBO_characters_MF <- HBO_MF %>%  rename(actor_name = name) %>% rename(name = character) %>% rename(year = release_year)


# drop unnecessary dataframes
rm(Top_100_Billboard, HBO_credits, HBO_titles, HBO_joined)
```

### Planning:

I will work at a national level. I want to have a summary table (bubble
plot) at the end with the 5 most popular names for each decade for boys
and girls. Interesting: Comparing persistence between TV characters and
actors/ music songs or artists

1.  factors influencing naming
2.  persistence of the trends

Putting this on a plot e.g. with Years or Decades on the Y-axis and most
popular Names on the X (N being the size of the name bubble), popular
character names in adult or children series. . . ’ ’

First I need to find the most popular baby names in each year and the
most popular TV celebrities in each year and the most popular songs /
artists in each year

## Baby Names

Since I want to work with decades: I need to create some functions that
will sort the names in the top 25 order for each decade.

```{r}
#check if year is numeric
str(Baby_Names$Year)

#create function to add decade column: decade_creator
#create function to create top25 names with a gender filter: Top25_Names_decade
```

It works better if I combine these two functions into the Top25_Names_decade function!
```{r}
# create top25 lists with the decade_Creator function and arrange by popularity
# just checking that it works: 

Top25_boynames_decade <- Top25_Names_by_Decade(Baby_Names, gender_filter = "M")
Top25_girlnames_decade <- Top25_Names_by_Decade(Baby_Names, gender_filter = "F")
```

I first created a function only for one of the genders and then amended
it to be more generic with a gender_filter so that we can use it throughout.

### Top25_plot
```{r}
# I loaded my plot_orderset function

top25_girlsplot <- top25_plot(df = Baby_Names, xaxis_size = 10, xaxis_rows = 2, gender_filter = "F")
top25_girlsplot

top25_boysplot <- top25_plot(df = Baby_Names, xaxis_size = 10, xaxis_rows = 2, gender_filter = "M")
top25_boysplot
```

I further wanted to identify names that were taken up more than usual in
each decade. So I created a function to extract that. Afterwards, I
added another geom_text to name each of the top 3 names taken up such
that

### Increase year-on-year
Create function for the increase year-on-year by decade! Now I can see the surges. I also added the function that it shows the top 3 names each decade and makes them a different colour. 
```{r}
top25_increaseplot(Baby_Names)
top25_increaseplot(Baby_Names, gender_filter =)
```

## HBO - movies and TV
Now, since I want to compare the correlation for girls and boys
separately, I need to infer the gender of the HBO and Billboard lists -
which I can do by looking each name up in the US-babynames dataset.

! I added the genders at the beginning. 

Now we can order the characters by their TMBD score in each decade and
capture the top 25 male and female actors in each decade. I first wanted
to see what the most popular names in TV characters was by applying the
top25 plot. This isn't working right now because the column names don't
match but I don't want to break something that is workign for the other
functions, so I'm going to continue with the ordering!

Let's just get the top 25 actors and actresses and the top 25 male and
female character names.

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- top25_girlscharactersplot <- top25_plot(df = HBO_characters_MF, xaxis_size = 10, xaxis_rows = 2, gender_filter = "F", year_col = release_year) -->

<!-- top25_girlsplot -->

<!-- top25_boycharactersplot <- top25_plot(df = HBO_characters_MF, xaxis_size = 10, xaxis_rows = 2, gender_filter = "M", year_col = release_year) -->

<!-- top25_boysplot -->

<!-- ``` -->

### Top 25 most popular characters overall
The setup here I don't like so much, because the big movies' small roles are comiing up. I need to filter that only lead/ supporting roles come up. 

I can see the genders are mostly showing up as NA, I presume it is because the names/ "first word"  of the characters likely not correct. 
I will now revisit my definition of HBO_characters_MF. 

I also want some first names but it might fall away if I do first word. 
Some of the character names have special characters that need cleaning

```{r, include = FALSE}
# 
# Top25_Characters_by_TMDB <- HBO_characters_MF %>%
#   filter(!is.na(Gender), !is.na(tmdb_score), !is.na(name)) %>% # only characters with a gender
#   group_by(Gender, name) %>%
#   summarise(avg_score = mean(tmdb_score), appearances = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
#   group_by(Gender) %>%
#   slice_max(order_by = avg_score, n = 25) %>% # only the top 25 ! :) 
#   ungroup()
# 
# popchars <- ggplot(Top25_Characters_by_TMDB, aes(x = reorder(character, avg_score), y = avg_score, fill = Gender)) +
#   geom_col(y = avg_score, show.legend = FALSE) +
#   facet_wrap(~Gender, scales = "free_y") +
#   coord_flip() +
#   labs(title = "Top 25 Characters by Average TMDB Score",
#        x = "Character", y = "Avg TMDB Score") +
#   theme_minimal()
# 
# popchars

```

Now let's do it by decade! 

### Popularity per decade
```{r}
library(forcats)
# not using this now since the previous is broken

# group_by(decade)

```

Since there are so many names and that becomes cluttered, I opted to
plot this with only the top 3/10 names per decade.

<!-- # ```{r} -->

<!-- # library(stringr) -->

<!-- #  -->

<!-- # Top10_Cleaned <- Top25_Characters_by_Decade %>% -->

<!-- #   mutate( -->

<!-- #     character = str_remove(character, "\\s*\\(uncredited\\)"),        # remove clutter -->

<!-- #     character = str_trunc(character, 40),                             # truncate long labels -->

<!-- #     Gender = factor(Gender, levels = c("F", "M"))                     # consistent ordering -->

<!-- #   ) %>% -->

<!-- #   group_by(decade, Gender) %>% -->

<!-- #   slice_max(order_by = avg_score, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE) %>% -->

<!-- #   ungroup() %>% -->

<!-- #   arrange(Gender, desc(avg_score)) %>% -->

<!-- #   mutate(character_ordered = fct_inorder(character)) -->

<!-- #  -->

<!-- # ggplot(Top10_Cleaned, aes(x = avg_score, y = character_ordered, colour = Gender)) + -->

<!-- #   geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) + -->

<!-- #   facet_wrap(~decade, scales = "free_y") + -->

<!-- #   theme_minimal(base_size = 11) + -->

<!-- #   labs( -->

<!-- #     title = "Top 10 HBO Characters by Gender and TMDB Score per Decade", -->

<!-- #     subtitle = "Ordered by Gender first, then TMDB Score (highest to lowest)", -->

<!-- #     x = "Avg TMDB Score", y = "Character" -->

<!-- #   ) + -->

<!-- #   theme( -->

<!-- #     axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7), -->

<!-- #     strip.text = element_text(size = 10), -->

<!-- #     legend.position = "top" -->

<!-- #   ) + -->

<!-- #   scale_colour_manual(values = c("F" = "#E377C2", "M" = "#1F77B4")) -->

<!-- <!-- ``` -->

This ALSO looks incredibly janky! I'm going to try to make it a bit more
neat by grouping by gender. I'm also only going to keep names that are
found in the baby_names list.

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- Top10_Table <- Top25_Characters_by_Decade %>% -->

<!--   mutate( -->

<!--     character = str_remove(character, "\\s*\\(uncredited\\)"), -->

<!--     character = str_trunc(character, 40), -->

<!--     decade = factor(decade), -->

<!--     Gender = factor(Gender, levels = c("F", "M")) -->

<!--   ) %>% -->

<!--   group_by(decade, Gender) %>% -->

<!--   slice_max(order_by = avg_score, n = 10) %>% -->

<!--   ungroup() %>% -->

<!--   arrange(decade, Gender, desc(avg_score)) %>% -->

<!--   select(Decade = decade, Gender, Character = character, `Avg TMDB Score` = avg_score, Appearances = appearances) -->

<!-- Top10_Table -->

<!-- library(gt) -->

<!-- library(huxtable) -->

<!-- ht <- as_hux(Top10_Table) -->

<!-- ht <- ht %>% -->

<!--   set_caption("Top 10 HBO Characters by Gender and TMDB Score per Decade") %>% -->

<!--   set_bold(1, everywhere, TRUE) %>% -->

<!--   set_number_format(everywhere, "Avg TMDB Score", fmt_pretty(1)) %>% -->

<!--   set_all_border_colors("grey90") %>% -->

<!--   set_all_padding(2) -->

<!-- ht -->

<!-- ``` -->

## BILLBOARD - musicians

I will see if I get to comparing these! It can be interesting to filter
the songs to only those containing a name that appears in the babyname
list.

## COMPARISON OF MATCHES

I want to find the top (n) baby names and see if they match the top (n)
actors and characters in that decade. I use a threshold for a movie to
be considered influential - only the popular movies are likely to have a
big impact on naming. I only take the top 50 actors.

I will create a function that gets the top increasing names, and then
compare them to the top movie actors/actresses in that decade, as well
as the popular movie characters in that decade to find "matches" within
decades and then we can see when it was most popular to do so and
whether it is still a trend in this decade to name your children after
movies/characters.

function: findmatches -\> not working so well function: newfindmatches
-\> will print a message saying what % matches there were!

This chunk is not working :( Need to come back to this!

```{r}
# result_girls <- findmatches_and_matchrate(Baby_Names, top_n = 25)
# print(result_girls$message)
# 
# result_boys <- findmatches_and_matchrate(Baby_Names, gender_filter = "M", top_n = 25)
# print(result_boys$message)
```

## SPEARMAN CORRELATION PLOTS

We want to see naming persistence over time - thus we want to see if top
names stay top names over time (year-on-year)

What is the correlation between this period and future periods/ past
periods popularity of name usage for girls and boys.

```{r}
Spearman(Baby_Names)
```

I want to see them together/ next to each other

```{r}
spearman_girls <- Spearman(df = Baby_Names, gender_filter = "F")
# spearman_girls

spearman_boys <- Spearman(df = Baby_Names,  gender_filter = "M")
# spearman_boys

# see side by side
cowplot::plot_grid(spearman_girls, spearman_boys, ncol = 1)
```

# Question 2: MUSIC TASTE

### Planning: 

First: popularity boxplot for each band per album
ridge graph for each of the 

Compare:
trends in components of music for spotify
trends in components for each band 
(can use ridgeplot ?) ggridges

Within analysis -> how versions (live, studio) affect metrics
Metallica -> "One" 
Get a nice comparison song by Coldplay

### Data cleaning! 
I had trouble with removing the special character in some of Metallica's album names with gsub, but it worked better with iconv ! So I created a function to use for later also!  
```{r}

# upload data
coldplay <- read_csv("./data/PracData25/Coldplay_vs_Metallica/Coldplay.csv")
metallica <- read_csv("./data/PracData25/Coldplay_vs_Metallica/metallica.csv")
spotify <- read_rds("./data/PracData25/Coldplay_vs_Metallica/Broader_Spotify_Info.rds")
billboard_100 <- read_rds("./data/PracData25/Coldplay_vs_Metallica/charts.rds")

#create the year cols

coldplay <- coldplay %>%
  mutate(year = year(as.Date(release_date)))

metallica <- metallica %>% 
    mutate(year = year(as.Date(release_date)))

billboard_100 <- billboard_100 %>% 
    mutate(year = year(as.Date(date)))

# Let's name the columns consistently & remove special characters in all dataframes

metallica <- metallica %>% rename(song = name) %>% mutate(artist = "Metallica") # remove special isn't working yet
coldplay <- coldplay %>% rename(album = album_name, song = name) %>%  mutate(artist = "Coldplay")
spotify <- spotify %>% rename(song = name)

# billboard is fine

#remove the special characters

# metallica %>% 
#       mutate(album = gsub("�", "", album))
#         mutate(album = gsub("\uFFFD", "", album, fixed = TRUE))
# 
# metallica %>%
#   mutate(album = gsub("[^[:ascii:]]", "", album))

metallica %>%
  mutate(album = iconv(album, from = "UTF-8", to = "ASCII", sub = ""))

metallica <- remove_special(metallica, col_name = c(song, album))

coldplay <- remove_special(coldplay, col_name = c(song, album))

```

To have a good comparison group for trends in popular music, I created a Spotify list that only contains songs that were also on the Billboard Top 100. I created the function called top100 for this. 
```{r}
spotify_top100 <- top100(spotify)
```

## Boxplots of album popularity

Just some regular boxplots. I also then divided it up by live and remastered albums for the respective bands for more sleek graphs because it was looking a bit too cluttered. 

The popularity of each of the bands are shown in a box-and-whiskers plot, showing the popularity scores per album. 

## Coldplay
### Overall
```{r}
albumpop_CP <- boxplotpopbyalbum(coldplay)
albumpop_CP
```
Coldplay is known for its live albums, with the live albums of "Live in Bueonos Aires" and "Live 2012" surpassing albums like "Love in Tokyo" and "Everyday Life" in popularity. 

### Live
```{r}
albumpop_CPL <- boxplotpopbyalbum(coldplay_live)
albumpop_CPL 
```

## Metallica
### Overall
```{r}
albumpop_ML <- boxplotpopbyalbum(metallica)
albumpop_ML
```
For Metallica, the remastered albums gain more traction, as seen by 7 of the top 10 most popular albums being remastered albums. 

### Studio
```{r}
albumpop_MLS <- boxplotpopbyalbum(metallica_studio)
albumpop_MLS
```


## Violin plots for song popularity within each album
 I saw on R graph gallery there are some nice new plots! Yay! So I can pick some for the rest of the analysis. 
  
Now let's look deeper into the popularity of the songs within each album. 
I created the function for this -> see songsinalbum_pop

```{r fig.align = 'center', fig.pos = "H", out.width = "80%"}
songspop <- songsinalbum_pop(together_studio)
```

## Ridgeline plot of trends in the components over time 
WIll be able to see over the years what type of music they started to do 
At first I tried this ggridges, but since there are so many years it is not great. I think I'll rather use the trends by components.

```{r}
ridgeplots(spotify, tempo)
```

Now I can compare the trends for both bands to popular spotify songs! 
First I need to create the function for the plots! 

I see now that the spotify timeframe is not the same as coldplay. Let's adjust Spotify by adding a filter that the minimum year is the same as the artist (this will be helpful for Metallica! 

## Timetrends

Now I can do this for different components, whichever suits the band best.
```{r}
timetrend_CP_dance<- timetrend_comp(df = coldplay_studio, artist = "Coldplay", variable = "danceability")
library(glue)
timetrend_CP_dance
```
 
 ## Compare studio vs Live albums
 
 Since I already created a live dataframe and a studio dataframe for ecah, I can just use that as the "comparison group" as I had spotify earlier. I just adusted the function a little and created a new one with the right dataframe references, because spotify was coded into the function earlier. 
 
```{r}
# Live vs Studio albums
#We can see that energy trends are much lower in Live albums, for both Coldplay and Metallica, but especially for Metallica. 
liveCP <- live_timetrend_comp(coldplay, coldplay_live, artist_name = "Coldplay Studio", compare_name = "Live Albums", variable = "energy")
liveCP

liveML <- live_timetrend_comp(metallica, metallica_live, artist_name = "Metallica Studio", compare_name = "Live Albums", variable = "energy")
liveML
```

The PDF was knitting the plots out of frame so I just adjusted those figures with a fig.pos. 

I still need to add some write-up and just decided which boxplots to include in the final PDF.

# Question 3: Netflix
Load the data: 

## upload data

```{r}
Titles <- read_rds("./Question3/data/netflix/titles.rds")
Credits <- read_rds("./Question3/data/netflix/credits.rds")
Movie_Info <- read_csv(".Question3/data/netflix/netflix_movies.csv")
```
## Data cleaning!

I started by looking at Titles. 

I cleaned the genres and production countries columns -> now I'm going to look at which countries produce the most movies, and see then which genres they produce. 

I think I will be able to create a ridgesplot here finally! yay!

```{r}
Titles <- clean_genres_titles(Titles)
Titles <- clean_production_countries(Titles)
```

First i created a top10 countries function on its own, but i rather combined it with the plot function to become top10countires_plot

## Plot 1 
```{r}
top10_plot <- top10countries_plot(Titles)
top10_plot
```

## Plot 2
Now I will adjust this to find the most popular genres, based on the total movie count. I can just adjust the function to be genres in stead of countries! 

```{r}

```

# Ridge plots
I will adjust the ridgesplot function I created for question 2 but didn't use here! 
I now created ggridgesplot. I added the mean score to the plot, added the average mean point. I changed the display around a bit but it actually looks best if I just keep the mean point small and then add the text on top of that. 

## Genre ratings of top countries
The genres with the highest average rating overall is documentary and history. This is not significantly higher than many other genres, often only being 0.1 points above another, ona scale of 1-10. 

```{r}
ggridgeIMDBscore <- ggridgesplot(Titles)
ggridgeIMDBscore
```

## Length of top rated movies
Here i can use the violin plot I used earlier for the song popularity! 
I also want to do the ggstream somewhere :) 

```{r}
violin_lengthplot(Titles)

```
